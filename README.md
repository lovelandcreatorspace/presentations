Loveland CreatorSpace Presentations
=============

A repository for presentations made in cooperation with the Loveland CreatorSpace. 
##### Upcoming Presentations: 
* ***"Digital logic: Build Your Own Logic Gate From Scratch" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)***  Cover the basics of digital logic; how do digital circuits represent data, some of the simple operations you can perform on the data, and how logic gates are constructed from transistors.  Next, actually build a logic gate on a breadboard. We'll start out with a NOT gate, and perhaps make some others as a stretch goal, or a follow-up course.  The theoretical parts won't be too onerous or heavy (although I'll happily take questions); they're mainly a brief introduction to the topic, so people can understand the the practical part of the lab. - *Presented by Stephen Warren ?/?/?*
* ***"Introduction to EAGLE" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)*** - *Presented by Casey Kuhns ?/?/?*
* ***"Crypto Cape Development Process" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)*** - *Presented by Josh Datko ?/?/?*
* ***"Introduction to Programming (with Scratch)" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)*** - *Presented by Jamie Leben ?/?/?*
* ***"Arduino 101 (Repeat!)" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)*** - *Presented by Daniel Packard ?/?/?*
* ***"Arduino 102" - [Coming soon!](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/coming_soon)*** - *Presented by Daniel Packard ?/?/?*


##### Recent Presentations:
* ***[Arduino 101: Programmable Circuits](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/101)*** Attendees were introduced to the Arduino opensource hardware development platform and the skills (electronics and software development) that they need to start building amazing creative projects. *Presented by Daniel Packard 2013/12/14*
* ***[Tor - Practical Internet Privacy](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/tor_internet_privacy)*** Creator Josh Datko discusses why internet privacy is important, and the different tools you can use to protect yourself online. To start a series of lectures, Josh provided an introduction to Tor, a powerful volunteer-driven network that can help you maintain your online anonymity. *Presented by Josh Datko 2013/11/20*
* ***["Crypto for Makers"](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/crypto_for_makers)*** - An open source coming of age story, in which cryptography plays a role. *Presented by Josh Datko 2013/11/13*
* ***["Evolution of a Kinetic Artist"](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/sculpture_young)*** - A recent transplant to Loveland, Colorado, sculptor and artist David Young discusses his work, his inspiration, and the challenges of constructing engaging and creative artwork from found materials. *Presented by David Young 2013/11/13*
