#### [Arduino 102 - Building Interactivity](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/102):

Build on the previous course by introducing more electronic components (sensors, motors, ICs, transistors, relays,  etc)

* Learn how to combine simple electronic circuits into complex circuits for real applications
* Combine a sensor and actuator, and develop your first interactive circuit.
* Develop more complex control programs, and learn about good structured programming practices.
