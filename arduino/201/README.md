#### [Arduino 201 - Serial Protocols](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/201):

Learn to interface your Arduino with a host computer by developing a serial communication protocol (requires basic linux skills)

* Learn the basics of serial communication (picocom, and Arduino Serial library)
* Learn the basics of request-response protocols
* Write a simple (but robust and extensible) serial protocol so you can interface an Arduino with a host computer.
