#### [Arduino 301 - Create a PCB Arduino Shield (Multi-day project)](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/301):
Once you've developed a useful prototype circuit on a breadboard, you can transform it into an Arduino Shield, which makes reusing and extending your circuit a breeze! (requires EAGLE electronic design experience)

* Layout your circuit so it can be made on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
* Solder on all your components
* Use your slick new Arduino shield PCB to impress your friends!
