This is a series of courses to introduce you to the open-source Arduino hardware development platform, presented by the Loveland CreatorSpace.

#### [Arduino 101 - Arduino Basics](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/101):

* What is an Arduino? Come find out!
* Install and learn your way around the Arduino IDE
* Build a simple circuit using a bread board and some basic electronic components
* Learn the structure of every Arduino program (yes, they're all basically the same structure)
* Meet the core Arduino libraries (digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogRead, analogWrite).
* Write a small program to control your circuit

#### [Arduino 102 - Building Interactivity](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/102):

Build on the previous course by introducing more electronic components (sensors, motors, ICs, transistors, relays,  etc)

* Learn how to combine simple electronic circuits into complex circuits for real applications
* Combine a sensor and actuator, and develop your first interactive circuit.
* Develop more complex control programs, and learn about good structured programming practices.

#### [Arduino 201 - Serial Protocols](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/201):

Learn to interface your Arduino with a host computer by developing a serial communication protocol (requires basic linux skills)

* Learn the basics of serial communication (picocom, and Arduino Serial library)
* Learn the basics of request-response protocols
* Write a simple (but robust and extensible) serial protocol so you can interface an Arduino with a host computer.

#### [Arduino 301 - Create a PCB Arduino Shield (Multi-day project)](https://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace/presentations/tree/master/arduino/301):
Once you've developed a useful prototype circuit on a breadboard, you can transform it into an Arduino Shield, which makes reusing and extending your circuit a breeze! (requires EAGLE electronic design experience)

* Layout your circuit so it can be made on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
* Solder on all your components
* Use your slick new Arduino shield PCB to impress your friends!
