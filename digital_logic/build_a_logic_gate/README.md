***Digital logic: Build Your Own Logic Gate From Scratch*** - Coming soon!

Cover the basics of digital logic; how do digital circuits represent data, some of the simple operations you can perform on the data, and how logic gates are constructed from transistors.  

Next, actually build a logic gate on a breadboard. We'll start out with a NOT gate, and perhaps make some others as a stretch goal, or a follow-up course.  The theoretical parts won't be too onerous or heavy (although I'll happily take questions); they're mainly a brief introduction to the topic, so people can understand the the practical part of the lab.
